Dynamic programming simply means solving a subproblem can optimize the whole solution.
using prev solutions for getting the next solutions.

optimization of the divide and conquer approach.

Property:

1. optimal substructure property. 
2. overlapping subproblem: same problem same solution.

Memorization :

solve bigger problems with recursion and save this solution for avoiding solving the sub-problem repeatedly.

The top-down approach
stored the solutions on the map and solved the problems with no similar 
solutions.

the bottom-up :
solve it from start to end with no recursion (Tabulation)


space of problems to solve using this approach : 
simply,should be solvable using prev solutions
